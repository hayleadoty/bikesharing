# Bike-sharing Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of our analysis was to build upon the visualizations we previously created regarding Citibike user data for New York City. We are building a proposal in preparation to start a bike-sharing campaign in Des Moines, Iowa, and plan to use the data from New York City to help present our proposal to perspective stakeholders in visually appealing ways using Tableau.

## Results

![Gender Breakdown](/images/gender.png)
The overwhelming majority of overall riders are male.

![Checkout Times for Users](/images/checkout_users.png)
Users tend to check bikes out for about 5-60 minutes.

![Checkout Times by Gender](/images/checkout_gender.png)
Men and women tend to check bikes out for the same amount of time (5-7 minutes). Those of unknown gender tend to check bikes out for anywhere from 7-40 minutes.

![Weekday for Each Hour](/images/weekday_hour.png)
Bikes are most often checked out from 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm Monday through Friday, with less of a consistent checkout pattern on Saturdays and Sundays. This makes sense, since we can expect users to use bikes to commute to-and-from work.

![Trips by Gender](/images/trips_gender.png)
This visualization is similar to the "Weekday for Each Hour" one. Here we can see the same breakdown of when bikes are checked out, but per gender. As expected, males checked out more bikes than female or unknown gender users.

![Trips by Gender by Weekday](/images/gender_weekday.png)
As expected, the majority of bikes checked out each day are done so by males. Subscribers utilize the bikes more often than regular customers. Specifically, male subscribers tend to check out the majority of bikes.

![Bike Repairs](/images/bike_repairs.png)
It's important to keep an eye on which bikes are utilized most often. This visualization shows which bikes need more attention than others, which gives us a good idea of how often we'll need to perform bike repairs.

## Summary

Overall, we found that male subscribers utilize bike-sharing more often than females or those of unspecified gender. Bikes are most often checked out during breakfast and dinnertime during the work week, and more consistently throughout the day on the weekends. Subscribers tend to utilize the bike-sharing service more often than one-time customers. Another visualization that could be performed using this dataset could include a study on which age cohort uses the bike-sharing service most often, as this could assist in deciding which locations to drop bikes (near college campuses, office buildings, etc). I would also like to take a deeper look at one-time customers vs. subscribers in relation to start and end stations. This could provide opportunities to reach out to local businesses, schools, etc for potential partnerships (discounted subscriptions or free one-time passes).
